excerpt: 'The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  explore  the  various  problems  which  arise  in  Russian numeral  constructions,  focusing  on  the  peculiar  case  patterns  following  the  lower numerals  2,  3,  and  4.  After  these  numerals,  nouns  realize  what  looks  like  genitive singular morphology. However, this morphological realization is inconsistent, notably in accusative environments and lexical case environments. To explain these patterns, I propose  that  Russian  lower  numerals  co-occur  with  paucal  number,  and  not  what  is traditionallyseen  as  singular  morphology.  While  the  idea  of  paucal  number  in Russian  is  not  necessarily  novel,  previous  analyses  of  paucal  number  identify  these basic patterns as instances of nominative paucal morphology (Bailyn & Nevins 2008, Rakhlin 2003). I argue that what we are seeing is paucal number with default genitive case (cf. Pesetsky 2013).'
