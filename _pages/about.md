title: "About Me"
excerpt: "I’m Sarah Asinari (she/her), I’m a 3rd year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Connecticut. I’m from the greater Scranton, PA region (yes, the same one from The Office).  I graduated from Queen Mary University of London with a First Class Joint Honours degree in Russian and Linguistics. 

I work on my dialect of English, Philadelphian Irish English, which I was exposed to by growing up with my grandmother, a true Irish Philly colleen. I also work on Slavic Languages, with a particular focus on morphology in numeral phrases. 

I’m a proud first generation college graduate, let alone academic. I come from a working class family, and I am very proud of the various jobs I’ve held throughout my life - from waitress, to cashier, to shelf stocker, to book seller, to facilities manager intern, to graduate admissions transcript coordinator. These jobs shaped me into the person I am today, a person who values interpersonal communication, teamwork, time management, and general management principles. 

I identify as a queer woman, this label means a lot to me in how I define myself."
